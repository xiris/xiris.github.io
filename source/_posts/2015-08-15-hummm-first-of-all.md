Well, how can I start? 

First of all, sorry for my english! If you don't understand something, don't worry because I have my own grammar :P

Now you accept my apology and motivated by some friends and other developers who inspired me, I decided to create this place to share my ideas, 
experiments, projects, tutorials and some other stuffs.

Thank you for reading and let me know if you have some question.

Cheers ...
